      <h3>KTM 390 Adventure</h3>
      <p>
        Outsider’s trusted machine. Lightweight, fearless, and ready for chaos.
        Outfitted with <strong>Thoska soft panniers</strong>, it carries what matters — tools, survival gear, and a past he won’t talk about.

      <h3>Rusted Handgun</h3>
      <p>
        Not for show. Not for glory.  
        This worn-out sidearm tells no stories — but it’s been in more than one.  
        Outsider carries it not to fight, but to finish what others start.
